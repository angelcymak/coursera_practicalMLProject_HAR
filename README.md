## Goal

Fit a model to on-body sensor training data to predict the dumbbell lifting actions of 20 test cases.

There are 5 possible classes of dumbbell lifting actions:  
* Class A. Lifting the dumbbell correctly
* Class B. Lifting the dumbbell incorrectly by throwing the elbows to the front
* Class C. Lifting the dumbbell incorrectly by lifting the dumbbell only halfway
* Class D. Lifting the dumbbell incorrectly by lowering the dumbbell only halfway
* Class E. Lifting the dumbbell incorrectly y throwing the hips to the front
